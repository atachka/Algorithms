This is a repository for some algorithms that I have written in [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).

## How to run

Just run the solutions as a single javascript file,
for example : C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Algorithms\easy\mergeSort.js

## Important!!!

The solutions that are provided in this repository might not be the most efficient in time or space complexity,
this is just my solution which I came up with or copied from the internet or written by A.I . :)
